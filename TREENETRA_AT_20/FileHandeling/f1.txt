Smoke testing is a preliminary software testing process that verifies the basic functionality of a new software build or release.
It's like a quick health check to ensure the most critical features are working before more comprehensive testing is
performed. This type of testing helps identify major issues early, preventing wasted time and resources on further
testing if the build is fundamentally broken.
