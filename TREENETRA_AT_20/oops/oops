oops :- paradigm --- object

var = data --- location --- object
2things are covered

data(attributes)---obj

methods(functions)-- obj

4 pillar inj oops

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymerprisim
Abnstraction

pops :- paradigm ----procedure (function) that operate on data-- slow
data --- fucntion are separate
less modular
no parent and child relationship, code reusablity is not possiable

python1, C, Pascal,perl


class :-
A class is a blueprint or template for creating the object.

if defines data(attributes) and method(behaviour) that the objects created from the class will have


laptop -- design -- pattern-- blueprint

    keyboard
    screen
    motherboard
    mouse
    th-port
    c-port
    ch-port
    cd-driver



what is a object?

object is a instance(fixed realization) of a class (actual data)

1.class is a template (not actual data)
2.object is a instance(fixed realization) of a class (actual data)
3.Classes help in creating multiple objects inside it, and that shared same strcture but have different data.
var -- data--location
methdo -- logic--data --- location

how many types of data--variable?

there are 3 tyeps of variables exits in class in oops python

instance variable
class variable
local variable


how many types of methods?

there are 3 tyeps of methods exits in class in oops python

instance method
class method
static method


how to write class in python, statement

syntax:-

class ClassName:
    define the variable
    define methods


how to call class

object_refernence =

object_refernence.variable
object_refernence.methods()



Note :- clas name  always be a Camel casing

what is object refernece ?

OR is a variable ,where we will store our class , so when a variable have to assign in class, then all the methdo and behiour should handel by the variable only.


class
object
class syntax
object_reference


what is method vs function?

list.append(), extend(),strip(),split(),join(),add()

who is inside a class.

function is independent, and not in a class
print(),type(),id(),eval(),filter()


what is a constructor?

constructor is method only, but the constructor name always be __init__. , pass the instance of class.


what is self?
self is a instance variable, who is vary from object to object


class

    self.name
    self.actiavation
    self.student

    def

    def

    def





class
object(var, method)
class syntax
object referenece
constrctor
self








def f1():
    instancee-- data -- logic--- return data
